## **Dual Pane File Explorer** *(Beta)*

## Implemented Features

- List view, and grid view with zoom
- Seperate files from folders in both views
- Traversable folder breadcrumb

- History for each pane and remembers last setup
- Thumbnail generation with caching *(including GIF!)*
- Search both panes, or filter each pane separately
- Light profanity for my sanity


### Planned features
